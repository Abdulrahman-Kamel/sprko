# how work this tool !
- we know burpsuite colloprator subdomain alike this: https://v2y8uryq3c1lcabnccvt90mct3zxnm.burpcollaborator.net , this subdomain if you request it will return value alike: 5kbwrxeq13zr5tzb96z54zzjmgz
- this tool take urls file or one url and then replace all parameters value to this burpsuite colloprator subdomain and request if found this value 5kbwrxeq13zr5tzb96z54zzjmgz this will be ssrf , but sometimes this parameter can be vuln to open redirect and will redirect you to this subdomain and will found this match , this one may be false positove but still vuln to open redirect
== > to skip this i make again match no have in subdomain colloprator => <html> <==
- after discover ssrf the tool can try to exploit and extract metadata files , this tec will work by this file config/metadata.json 
- metadata.json: file contains on 8 cloud every cloud contain on internal ips and metadata files and others required , now the tool will request this paths and match on response which found in metadata.json file if found this will be mtadafile file 
- the tool can report you to slack or telegram if you want that move to file confg/sender.yaml and put your secrets and run tool with -r or --report
- you can change some info or add multiple checks in file config/metadata.json to work اكثؤ احترافيه
